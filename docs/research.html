            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Sketching out a rough idea</h3>
                    <p>First, I started out with drawing out a few sketches of the system and how it will work!
                         I took many factors into consideration such as the friction in the rods and the materials
                         I'm using!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Conduct background research</h3>
                    <p>Conduct a background research check to understand the existing technologies and tools used for creating
                        similar projects. This can include researching about robotic bartenders and their components
                        such as motor shields, microcontrollers, and stepper motors.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Identify the required hardware and software components</h3>
                    <p>After understanding the various components involved in the project, identify the required
                        hardware and software components. This can include an Arduino board, an Adafruit Motor Shield
                        v2, stepper motors, a limit switch, an RGB LED, various wires and breadboard, an 8mm steel rod,
                        linear bearings, timing belt and pulley, and a contact switch. For software, the Adafruit Motor
                        Shield library and the Arduino IDE are required.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Create a wiring diagram</h3>
                    <p>Before beginning the actual assembly of the hardware components, create a wiring diagram to
                        visualize the connections between the components and avoid errors while assembling.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Assemble the hardware components</h3>
                    <p>Begin the process of assembling the hardware components by connecting the various components such
                        as the Arduino board, motor shield, stepper motors, limit switch, and RGB LED, following the
                        wiring diagram. Use the 8mm steel rod, linear bearings, timing belt and pulley, and contact
                        switch to create a linear actuator for the pouring mechanism.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Upload the code to the microcontroller</h3>
                    <p>Once the hardware components are assembled, upload the KetanBot.ino sketch to the Arduino board
                        using the Arduino IDE. The sketch uses the Adafruit Motor Shield library to control the stepper
                        motors and limit switch, and uses serial communication to receive input from the user in the
                        specified format.</p
